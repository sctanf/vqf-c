 *     [Accepted manuscript available at `arXiv:2203.17024 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17024>`_.]
 *

 * without magnetometer data. It performs rest detection, gyroscope bias estimation during rest and motion, and magnetic
 * disturbance detection and rejection. Different sampling rates for gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers are
 * supported as well. While in most cases, the defaults will be reasonable, the algorithm can be influenced via a
 * number of tuning parameters.
 *

 * 1. create a instance of the class and provide the sampling time and, optionally, parameters
 * 2. for every sample, call one of the update functions to feed the algorithm with IMU data
